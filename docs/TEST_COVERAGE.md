```

## Key Testing Achievements

1. **Complete Function Coverage**: All public functions in all modules are tested
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Comprehensive edge case coverage for error conditions
3. **Integration Testing**: Full lifecycle tests for server operations
4. **Restart Functionality**: Thorough testing of the new port-specific restart feature
5. **Error Handling**: All error paths are tested and verified

## Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to:
- Run quickly (< 1 minute for full suite)
- Provide clear failure messages
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Future Considerations

While we have achieved 100% function coverage, consider:
- Performance testing under load
- Long-running stability tests
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Security testing for HTTP endpoints
